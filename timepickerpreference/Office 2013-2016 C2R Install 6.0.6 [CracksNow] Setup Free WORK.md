Save the file to a folder on your computer and extract it using a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
 
## Step 2: Customize the configuration.xml file
 
The next step is to customize the configuration.xml file according to your preferences. This file allows you to choose which version, edition, language, and components of Office you want to install.
 
Open the configuration.xml file with a text editor like Notepad and edit the following attributes:
 
- **OfficeClientEdition**: This attribute specifies whether you want to install the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Office. The possible values are "32" or "64". For example, if you want to install the 64-bit version, change the attribute to OfficeClientEdition="64".
- **Product ID**: This attribute specifies which edition of Office you want to install. The possible values are "ProPlusRetail", "ProfessionalRetail", "HomeBusinessRetail", "HomeStudentRetail", "O365ProPlusRetail", "O365BusinessRetail", "VisioProRetail", or "ProjectProRetail". For example, if you want to install Office Professional Plus, change the attribute to Product ID="ProPlusRetail".
- **Language ID**: This attribute specifies which language of Office you want to install. The possible values are the language codes listed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_standards/ms-oe376/6c085406-a698-4e12-9d4d-c3b0ee3dbc4a). For example, if you want to install English (United States), change the attribute to Language ID="en-us".
- **ExcludeApp ID**: This attribute specifies which components of Office you want to exclude from the installation. The possible values are "Access", "Excel", "Groove", "Lync", "OneDrive", "OneNote", "Outlook", "PowerPoint", "Publisher", or "Word". For example, if you want to exclude Access and Publisher, add the following lines inside the <add> tag:</add>

`<ExcludeApp ID="Access" />`
 
`<ExcludeApp ID="Publisher" />`
 
Save the configuration.xml file after making your changes.
 
## Step 3: Download Office setup files
 
The third step is to download the Office setup files using the setup.exe file. But it will not work if you try to directly run the setup.exe file.
 
Open the folder containing setup.exe and configuration.xml files. Now press and hold SHIFT key on your keyboard and then right-click on an empty area in the folder. Select "Open command window here"
