Mach3 is a popular CNC software that allows you to control up to 6 axes of motion. However, the default screenset for Mach3 only supports 3 or 4 axes. If you want to use a 5 axis CNC machine with Mach3, you need to download and install a custom screenset that can display and control the additional axes.

A screenset is a set of files that defines the layout and functionality of the Mach3 interface. Screensets for Mach3Mill use a .set extension and screensets for Mach3Turn use a .lset extension. All screensets should be saved in the Mach3 installation directory (typically C:\Mach3).
 
There are several 5 axis screensets available for download on the internet, but not all of them are compatible with the latest version of Mach3 or Windows 7. In this article, we will show you how to download and install one of the most popular 5 axis screensets for Mach3, which is based on the 6 axis screenset from Newfangled Solutions.
 
## Step 1: Download the 6 Axis Screenset
 
The first step is to download the 6 axis screenset from Newfangled Solutions. You can find it on their website under Downloads & Updates > Screensets[^1^]. The file name is 6axis.zip and it contains two files: 6axis.set and a folder called UT Buttons-JPG.
 
## Step 2: Extract and Copy the Files
 
The next step is to extract the contents of the zip file. You can use any software that can handle zip files, such as WinZip or 7-Zip. After extracting, you should have a .set file and a folder full of graphics.
 
Then, you need to copy the files into the correct locations. Copy the 6axis.set file into the Mach3 installation directory (typically C:\Mach3). Copy the UT Buttons-JPG folder into the Mach3\Bitmaps\MillBitmaps folder. Make sure you overwrite any existing files if prompted.
 
## Step 3: Load the Screenset
 
The final step is to load the screenset in Mach3. Open Mach3 and click on View > Load Screens. Then, select the 6axis.set file from the list and click Open. You should see a new interface with buttons and indicators for all 6 axes.
 
You can now use your 5 axis CNC machine with Mach3. To configure your machine settings, such as steps per unit, motor tuning, homing and limits, go to Config > Ports and Pins > Motor Outputs and Config > Motor Tuning. To jog your axes, use the arrow keys on your keyboard or click on the buttons on the screen. To run a G-code program, load it from File > Load GCode and click Cycle Start.
