The film is directed by Wong Tsz-ming, a newcomer from Hong Kong who makes his feature debut with this film. The screenplay is written by Tan Cheung and Fengxiang Yang, who also wrote the hit comedy *Lost in Thailand*. The film features a star-studded cast that includes Cecilia Liu Shishi, Michelle Chen, Raymond Lam, Collin Chou, Stephen Fung, Xiaoming Huang, and many more.

The film was released in China on June 28, 2013, and was a commercial success, grossing over 200 million yuan at the box office. It received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, who praised the film's humor and action, but criticized its plot and direction. Some fans of Jet Li were also disappointed by his limited screen time and lack of serious fighting scenes. However, if you are looking for a silly and entertaining movie to pass the time, you might enjoy **Badges of Fury (2013).rar**, which you can download from various online sources.
  
One of the highlights of **Badges of Fury (2013).rar** is the chemistry between Jet Li and Wen Zhang, who play the odd couple of Huang Feihong and Wang Bu'er. Huang is a veteran detective who is calm and smart, while Wang is a rookie cop who is clumsy and naive. The two often bicker and argue, but also work together to solve the case. Jet Li and Wen Zhang have collaborated before in two other films, *Ocean Heaven* and *The Sorcerer and the White Snake*, and their friendship and rapport are evident on screen. They also show off their kung fu skills in some amusing and creative fight scenes, such as a battle with a fortune teller, a chase on bicycles, and a showdown with a gang of thugs.
 
Another highlight of the film is the cameo appearances by many famous actors and actresses, who play the suspects or the victims of the Smile Murders. Some of them are Liu Jingshui's ex-boyfriends, who have different professions and personalities. They include Kevin Cheng, Michael Tse, Tong Dawei, and Liang Tian. Some of them are Liu Jingshui's relatives or friends, who have secrets and motives. They include Liu Yan, Leung Kar-yan, Leung Siu-lung, and Stephen Fung. Some of them are unrelated to the case, but add to the comedy and confusion. They include Tian Liang, Tse Tin-wah, and Cheng Kar-wing. The film also features some references and jokes related to these actors' previous works or real-life scandals.
 
If you are a fan of Jet Li or Wen Zhang, or if you like action comedies with a touch of mystery and romance, you might want to give **Badges of Fury (2013).rar** a try. It is not a masterpiece or a classic, but it is a fun and enjoyable movie that will make you laugh and smile.
