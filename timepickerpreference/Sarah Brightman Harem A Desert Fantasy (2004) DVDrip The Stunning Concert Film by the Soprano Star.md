The album *Harem* was inspired by Sarah Brightman's childhood fascination with the Arabian Nights stories, as well as her travels to North Africa and the Middle East. She wanted to create an album that blended classical, pop, and world music influences, and that captured the mystery and beauty of those regions. She collaborated with her longtime producer Frank Peterson, who helped her incorporate exotic instruments and melodies into her songs. She also worked with various guest artists, such as classical violinist Nigel Kennedy, Iraqi singer Kadim Al Sahir, Egyptian singer Natacha Atlas, and Indian singer Shweta Shetty.
 
The album features 13 tracks, plus some bonus and unreleased tracks depending on the region. The title track *Harem* is a remake of the traditional Portuguese song *CanÃ§Ã£o do Mar*, which was popularized by singer Dulce Pontes. The song showcases Sarah's operatic range and Arabic vocalizations, as well as a dance beat and orchestral arrangements. The song *It's a Beautiful Day* is a mash-up of Sarah's original pop song and Puccini's aria *Un Bel Di* from the opera *Madama Butterfly*. The song *The Journey Home* is based on a melody by Indian composer A.R. Rahman, who wrote the music for the musical *Bombay Dreams*, in which Sarah starred in 2002. The song *The War is Over Now* is a duet with Kadim Al Sahir, who sings in Arabic while Sarah sings in English. The song is about the aftermath of war and the hope for peace.
 
The album received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Sarah's vocals and the diversity of musical styles. The album was also commercially successful in some territories, especially in Japan, where it became her first top 10 album ever. It also topped the US Top Classical Albums chart for seven consecutive weeks, and became the only album ever to have simultaneously held the number 1 spot in Billboard's Classical and Dance charts. The album was followed by a world tour, which was documented in two DVDs: *Harem: A Desert Fantasy* and *The Harem World Tour: Live from Las Vegas*.
