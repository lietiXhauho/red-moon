# How to Use Cakewalk Boost 11 Vst Plugin to Enhance Your Mixes
  
If you are looking for a transparent peak limiting and volume maximizing plugin for mixing and mastering purposes, you might want to check out Cakewalk Boost 11 Vst plugin. This plugin is designed to reduce peak levels without coloring the sound, and to increase the perceived loudness of your tracks. In this article, we will show you how to use Cakewalk Boost 11 Vst plugin to improve your mixes and make them sound more professional.
  
## What is Cakewalk Boost 11 Vst Plugin?
  
Cakewalk Boost 11 Vst plugin is a plugin that comes with Cakewalk Sonar and Cakewalk software. It is based on a âlook-aheadâ limiter algorithm that prevents output clipping and minimizes pumping (audible fluctuations of the volume). It also features a Program Dependent Release (PDR) that adjusts the release time according to the input signal. This way, it preserves the natural dynamics of your audio while maximizing the loudness.

- **Input Gain**: This knob allows you to adjust the amount of gain applied to the input signal before it reaches the limiter. You can use this knob to increase or decrease the level of your audio until it reaches the desired loudness. A good practice is to set the input gain so that the input meter shows occasional peaks around -3 dB.
- **Output Ceiling**: This knob sets the maximum output level that the limiter will allow. You can use this knob to prevent clipping and distortion in your audio. A common setting is -0.1 dB, which leaves some headroom for further processing or encoding.
- **Release Mode**: This switch lets you choose between two release modes: Auto or Manual. Auto mode uses the PDR algorithm to adjust the release time automatically according to the input signal. Manual mode lets you set a fixed release time with the Release Time knob.
- **Release Time**: This knob sets the release time of the limiter when in Manual mode. The release time is the time it takes for the limiter to return to its normal state after reducing the gain. A shorter release time can make your audio sound louder, but it can also cause more pumping and distortion. A longer release time can make your audio sound smoother, but it can also reduce the loudness and impact. A good starting point is 100 ms, but you can adjust it according to your preference and material.

After adjusting these controls, you can compare the input and output waveforms and meters to see how much gain reduction and loudness increase are applied by the limiter. You can also use the Bypass button to compare the processed and unprocessed audio.
  
## Conclusion
  
Cakewalk Boost 11 Vst plugin is a powerful tool that can help you enhance your mixes and make them sound more professional. By using a âlook-aheadâ limiter algorithm and a PDR feature, it can reduce peak levels without coloring the sound, and increase the perceived loudness of your tracks without compromising their dynamics. You can use it on individual tracks or on the master bus, depending on your needs and goals.
