- Basic statistics: descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, correlation, regression, ANOVA, and more.

- Customization: macros, scripts, menus, toolbars, and more.

Minitab 15 is compatible with Windows 10 or Windows 11 operating systems. It requires a 64-bit x86 processor (ARM processors are not supported), 4 GB of RAM or more recommended, 2 GB of hard disk space (minimum), and a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 or higher[^3^].
 
If you want to download Minitab 15 for free, you might be tempted to look for a crack serial number online. However, this is not a good idea for several reasons:

- It is illegal: cracking software is a form of piracy that violates the intellectual property rights of the software developers. You could face legal consequences if you are caught using cracked software.
- It is risky: cracked software often comes with malware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. You could lose your data or compromise your security if you install cracked software.
- It is unreliable: cracked software often does not work properly or has limited functionality. You could miss out on important features or updates that are available in the official version of the software.

Therefore, it is better to avoid using cracked software and instead purchase a legitimate license of Minitab 15 from the official website[^1^]. You can also try Minitab 21.3 Desktop for free for 30 days[^2^], which is the latest version of the software that offers even more features and enhancements than Minitab 15.

In this article, we will show you how to use some of the features of Minitab 15 to perform data analysis. We will use an example dataset that contains information about the sales of a company. The dataset has four columns: Region, Product, Quantity, and Revenue. You can download the dataset from here: [mt15salesdata.mtw](https://www.minitab.com/uploadedFiles/Content/News/Published_Articles/mt15salesdata.mtw).
 
## Importing Data
 
To import the data into Minitab 15, follow these steps:

1. Open Minitab 15 and click File > Open Worksheet.
2. Browse to the location where you saved the dataset and select it.
3. Click Open. The data will appear in the Minitab worksheet.

## Descriptive Statistics
 
To get a summary of the data, such as the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of each column, follow these steps:

1. Click Stat > Basic Statistics > Display Descriptive Statistics.
2. In the Variables box, select all four columns: Region, Product, Quantity, and Revenue.
3. Click OK. The descriptive statistics will appear in the Session window.

You can see that there are four regions (North, South, East, and West), three products (A, B, and C), and the quantity and revenue range from 1 to 100 and from 10 to 1000 respectively. The mean quantity is 50.5 and the mean revenue is 505.5.
 
## Histograms
 
To create histograms of the quantity and revenue columns, follow these steps:

1. Click Graph > Histogram > Simple.
2. In the Graph variables box, select Quantity.
3. Click OK. A histogram of the quantity column will appear in a separate window.
4. Repeat steps 1 to 3 for the revenue column.

You can see that both histograms are approximately symmetric and bell-shaped, indicating that the data are normally distributed.
