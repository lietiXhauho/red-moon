Nondestructive testing (NDT) is a term that describes a wide range of methods and techniques that are used to inspect, test, or evaluate materials, components, or assemblies without causing damage or altering their serviceability. NDT can be applied to various industries and applications, such as aerospace, automotive, construction, energy, manufacturing, medical, and transportation. Some of the common NDT methods include acoustic emission, eddy current, liquid penetrant, magnetic particle, radiographic, thermal infrared, ultrasonic, and visual testing.

Predictive maintenance (PdM) is a term that describes a proactive approach to maintaining equipment and systems by using data and analysis to predict when they will need servicing or repair. PdM can help reduce downtime, improve performance, extend service life, and lower maintenance costs. PdM can be implemented by using various techniques and tools, such as vibration analysis, oil analysis, thermography, acoustic emission, ultrasonic testing, and electrical testing.
 
Both NDT and PdM are valuable for ensuring the quality, reliability, and safety of products and services. They can help detect defects, flaws, cracks, corrosion, wear, leaks, or other anomalies that may affect the functionality or integrity of the inspected object. They can also help prevent failures, accidents, injuries, or environmental hazards that may result from undetected problems. By using NDT and PdM methods and standards such as ANSI/ASNT CP-189, you can enhance your skills and knowledge in these fields and contribute to creating a safer world.
