Now that you have installed the crack, you need to restore your save game files from the backup you made earlier. Go to the folder where you copied your save game files and open it. You will see a subfolder named `720`. Copy this subfolder and paste it into the following location:
 `C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Roaming\uplay_r1_loader64\savegames\[your account id]\720` 
If you don't see the `AppData` folder, you may need to enable hidden files and folders in your Windows settings. To do this, open File Explorer and click on the View tab. Check the box that says "Hidden items" and apply the changes.
 
Replace the existing subfolder when prompted. This will restore your save game files to the new location.
