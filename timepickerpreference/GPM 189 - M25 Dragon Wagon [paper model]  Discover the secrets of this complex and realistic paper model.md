To build the GPM 189 - M25 Dragon Wagon paper model, you will need the following materials and tools:
 
- Cardstock paper (160-200 gsm)
- White glue
- Scissors
- Craft knife
- Ruler
- Needle
- Thread
- Paint (optional)

The first step is to download the files from the PaperModelers.com forum. You will need to register for free to access the files. The files are in PDF format and include the instructions and the parts. You can print the parts on cardstock paper using a color printer or a black and white printer and paint them later. You can also adjust the scale of the parts if you want to make a smaller or larger model.
 
The second step is to cut out the parts using scissors or a craft knife. Be careful not to damage the parts or cut yourself. You can use a ruler to help you make straight cuts. You should also score the fold lines using a needle or an empty ballpoint pen to make them easier to fold.
 
The third step is to glue the parts together following the instructions. You can use white glue or any other glue that works well with paper. You should apply a thin layer of glue on the tabs and press them firmly until they stick. You can use clamps or clothespins to hold the parts together while they dry. You should also use thread to reinforce some parts such as the axles, the hinges, and the cables.
 
The fourth step is to assemble the subassemblies into the final model. You should follow the instructions carefully and make sure that everything fits well and moves smoothly. You can also paint some parts if you want to add more realism or weathering effects.
