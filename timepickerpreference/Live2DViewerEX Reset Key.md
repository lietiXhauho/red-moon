## Reset Settings
 
If you want to reset your Live2DViewerEX settings, such as the resolution, window size, frame rate, or sound volume, you can do so by deleting the config.ini file in the installation folder. This file stores your preferences and options for the software. To delete it, follow these steps:
 
1. Close Live2DViewerEX if it is running.
2. Open the installation folder of Live2DViewerEX. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Live2DViewerEX.
3. Find and delete the config.ini file.
4. Restart Live2DViewerEX. It will create a new config.ini file with the default settings.

## Reset Expressions
 
If you want to reset your Live2DViewerEX expressions, such as the eye, mouth, or eyebrow movements, you can do so by using one of these methods:

- Create an empty exp file to reset the expression. An exp file is a text file that contains commands for changing the character's expression. To create an empty exp file, follow these steps:
    - Open a text editor such as Notepad.
    - Save the file as empty.exp in the installation folder of Live2DViewerEX.
    - In Live2DViewerEX, right-click on the character and select Load Expression File.
    - Select empty.exp from the list and click OK.
- Create a motion event with command 'clear\_exp'. A motion event is a trigger that activates an action when certain conditions are met. To create a motion event with command 'clear\_exp', follow these steps:
    - In Live2DViewerEX, right-click on the character and select Edit Motion Events.
    - Click on Add Event at the bottom of the window.
    - Select a condition for triggering the event, such as Mouse Click or Time Interval.
    - In the Action field, type clear\_exp and click OK.
    - Click on Save Events at the bottom of the window.

These methods will reset your character's expression to the default one. You can also use other commands to change your character's expression, such as change\_cos to change the outfit, or opacity to change the transparency.
