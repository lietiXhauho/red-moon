## Step 2: Download Europa Universalis IV on Steam
 
After you have bought Europa Universalis IV on Steam, you can download it on your PC. To do so, go to your Steam Library and find Europa Universalis IV in your list of games. Right-click on it and select "Install Game". This will open a window where you can choose where to install the game on your PC.

By default, Steam will download the game in its uncompressed form, which means it will take up more space and time than necessary.

To use this command line argument, right-click on Europa Universalis IV in your Steam Library and select "Properties". This will open a window where you can see various options for the game. Go to the "General" tab and click on "Set Launch Options". This will open another window where you can type in commands that will affect how the game runs.
 
In this window, type in "-compress" (without quotation marks) and click "OK". This will tell Steam to download the game in a compressed way. You can also add other commands if you want to customize other aspects of the game, such as resolution, language or mods. You can find a list of all available commands at [https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Command\_line\_arguments](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Command_line_arguments).
