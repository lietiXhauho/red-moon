## What is FXpansion Tremor 1006?
 
FXpansion Tremor 1006 is a software drum machine that was released in 2012 by FXpansion, a company that specializes in creating innovative music software and virtual instruments. Tremor 1006 is the latest version of Tremor, which has been updated with bug fixes and compatibility improvements.
 
Tremor 1006 is available for Windows and Mac OS X, and it can run as a standalone application or as a plugin in VST, AU, or RTAS formats. It supports both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
 
Tremor 1006 is designed to be easy to use, but also flexible and powerful. It has eight drum synthesis engines, each with its own oscillator, filter, envelope, drive, distortion, and effects. You can mix and match different synthesis types, such as subtractive, FM, or physical modelling, to create unique drum sounds.
 
Tremor 1006 also has a built-in sequencer that lets you program up to 24 patterns with up to 32 steps each. You can use the sequencer to create complex rhythms and grooves, or trigger sounds via MIDI from your DAW or hardware controller. The sequencer also has swing, shuffle, accent, flam, roll, and humanize functions to add more variation and expression to your beats.
 
One of the most distinctive features of Tremor 1006 is the TransMod modulation system. This system allows you to modulate almost any parameter of the synthesis engines or effects with a variety of sources, such as LFOs, envelopes, step sequencers, velocity, or MIDI CCs. You can set the modulation depths visually and intuitively by dragging modulation wires on the interface. The TransMod system gives you endless possibilities to shape and animate your drum sounds.
