If you have installed Windows on your computer, you might need to activate it with a product key or a digital license. Activation helps verify that your copy of Windows is genuine and hasn't been used on more devices than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. In some cases, you might need to use a confirmation ID to complete the activation process.

A confirmation ID is a 48-digit code that you get from Microsoft when you activate Windows by phone. You can also get a confirmation ID from a website if you have a volume license key (VLK) and use Key Management Service (KMS) to activate Windows. A confirmation ID is different from a product key, which is a 25-character code that you enter when you install or reinstall Windows.
 
In this article, we will show you how to activate Windows with a confirmation ID in different scenarios.

1. Open the Start menu and type `slui 4` in the search box. Press Enter to open the Windows Activation wizard.
2. Select your country or region from the drop-down list and click Next.
3. You will see an installation ID on the screen. Write it down or copy it to a text file.
4. Call the toll-free number that appears on the screen and follow the voice prompts. You will be asked to enter the installation ID using your phone keypad.

6. Go back to the Windows Activation wizard and enter the confirmation ID in the boxes. Click Next to activate Windows.

## How to Activate Windows with a Confirmation ID by KMS

3. Enter the installation ID and product ID in the corresponding fields and click Get Confirmation ID.
4. You will see a confirmation ID on the screen. Write it down or copy it to a text file.
5. Go back to the elevated command prompt and run the command `slmgr.vbs /atp \ \` to activate Windows with the confirmation ID and activation ID. You can get the activation ID from [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/kmsclientkeys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/kmsclientkeys).

## Conclusion
 
Activating Windows with a confirmation ID is not very common, but it can be useful in some situations where online activation is not possible or convenient. You can get a confirmation ID by phone or by KMS, depending on your license type and activation method. Once you have the confirmation ID, you can enter it in the Windows Activation wizard or use it with the slmgr.vbs command to activate Windows.
