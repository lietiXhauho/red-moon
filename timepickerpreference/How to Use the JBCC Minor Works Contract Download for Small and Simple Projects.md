# How to Download JBCC Minor Works Contract for Your Construction Project
  
If you are involved in a small-scale construction project, such as a renovation, alteration, or repair work, you may need to use the JBCC Minor Works Contract (MWA) to regulate your contractual relationship with the contractor. The MWA is a standard form of contract published by the Joint Building Contracts Committee (JBCC), which is a representative body of building owners, developers, consultants, and contractors in South Africa.
  
The MWA is designed to be simple, concise, and user-friendly, and it covers the essential aspects of a construction contract, such as scope of work, payment terms, completion date, defects liability, and dispute resolution. The MWA is suitable for projects with a contract value of up to R1.5 million and a duration of up to six months.

To download the MWA, you need to visit the JBCC website at [https://jbcc.co.za/free-forms/](https://jbcc.co.za/free-forms/) and scroll down to the section titled "Free Forms". There you will find various JBCC documents that you can download for free in PDF format. The MWA is listed as "MWA Contract Data" under the heading "JBCC FREE FORMS". You can click on the link to download the document to your device.
  
The MWA consists of two parts: the contract data and the agreement. The contract data contains unique information and variables applicable to your specific project, such as the names and details of the parties, the contract price, the commencement and completion dates, and the retention percentage. The agreement contains the general conditions of contract that apply to all projects using the MWA.
  
Before you download the MWA, you should read the preface carefully, as it contains important information and instructions on how to use the document. You should also consult a professional consultant or legal advisor if you have any questions or doubts about the MWA or your contractual obligations.
  
Once you have downloaded the MWA, you need to fill in the required information in the contract data and sign it together with the contractor. The signed MWA, together with the priced document, drawings, and other listed documents, will form your contract documents for your project.
  
The MWA is a convenient and cost-effective way to manage your minor works project with a contractor. By downloading and using the MWA from the JBCC website, you can ensure that your contract is compliant with the latest industry standards and best practices.
