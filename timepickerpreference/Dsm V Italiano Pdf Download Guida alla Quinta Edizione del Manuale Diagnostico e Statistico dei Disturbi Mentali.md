The DSM-5-TRÂ® is organized into three sections. Section I provides an overview of the history, purpose, structure and use of the manual, as well as some general principles and guidelines for diagnosis. Section II contains the diagnostic criteria and codes for all the mental disorders included in the manual, grouped into 22 chapters according to common features or clinical presentation. Section III contains some emerging measures and models that are intended to enhance clinical decision making and research, such as the Cultural Formulation Interview, the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders, and the Level of Personality Functioning Scale.
 
The DSM-5-TRÂ® is not a definitive or comprehensive source of information on mental disorders. It is a dynamic and evolving document that reflects the current state of knowledge and consensus in the field. It is also a descriptive and categorical system that does not imply any specific etiology or treatment for any disorder. The diagnosis of a mental disorder is based on a clinical judgment that considers the individual's symptoms, context, history, functioning and impairment. The DSM-5-TRÂ® is meant to be used in conjunction with other sources of information and clinical expertise, as well as with respect for the individual's dignity and autonomy.
 
The DSM-5-TRÂ® is a valuable resource for all professionals and researchers who work in the field of mental health, including psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, educators, counselors, therapists, and legal experts. It is also a useful tool for anyone who wants to learn more about mental disorders and their impact on individuals and society. The Italian edition of DSM-5-TRÂ® is available for download from the publisher's website or from some academic platforms. However, before using or reproducing any part of the text, you should check the copyright and authorization policies of APA and Raffaello Cortina Editore.
